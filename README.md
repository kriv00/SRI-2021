## COVID-19 Data Anaylsis
This project analyzes the United States and South Florida COVID-19 vaccinations and death rates. All data is provided by the Center for Disease Control (CDC).

The goal was to gain a clear understanding of the current status of vaccination rates and deaths in the United States and specifically in the State of Florida from the beginning of the pandemic to mid-July of 2021.

## Predictive Analysis of STU Women's Soccer Performance
The goal of this project was to determine the most influential match and sensor statistics for predicting soccer performance. Additionally, we  researched how the use of predictive analysis in STU women’s soccer may help to improve the team’s success rate. Finally, we researched if there was a difference between the Linear regression and Loess regression for predicting team performance.

The most influential variables varied depending on the position analyzed. Variables that correlated to match outcome for forwards included: number of short possessions and average seconds on the ball. Midfielders saw an association with variables such as maximum speed and work rate. Finally, defenders had strong correlations with total number of touches. Based on this anaylsis, STU Women's Soccer will be able to use match results to more accurately predict future game outcomes.
